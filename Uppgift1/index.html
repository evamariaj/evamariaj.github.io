<p style="font-family:verdana"> Don Johnson <strong><i>(Donald Wayne Johnson)</i></strong> is an American actor best known for his part as Sonny Crocket
in  the tv-series Miami Vice, for which he won a Golden Globe. He also played the title character on the series Nash Bridges.
In 2014, he had a supporting role in the romantic comedy The Other Woman. He'd later begin starring in HBO's Watchmen in 2019.

<p style="font-family:verdana"> 
He began to take interest in acting after becoming involved in his school theatre programs. After graduation, he studied drama 
at ‘American Conservatory Theatre’ in San Francisco. Although he got his first major role at the age of 20, it took him 
some time to establish himself as a star. His fortune changed for the better when he got an opportunity to play the role 
of ‘Sonny Crockett’ in the popular television series ‘Miami Vice.’ He then became a star overnight. Once the series ended, 
he was invited to play the lead role in many well-known films and television serials. Till date, he has more than 90 film 
and TV titles to his credit. Over the years, he has also released three music albums, which have been well-received by 
music lovers. Despite having a successful career, Don has had his share of problems. In 2008, he almost lost his Colorado 
ranch because of his $14.5 million debt. His personal life too has been marred with divorces and separations.
